title: "IPCC AR7 WGI Figure 3.3: Annual mean surface temperature (1995–2014)"
description: "The figure shows the annual-mean surface (2 m) air temperature (°C) for the 
    period 1995–2014. (a) Multi-model (ensemble) mean constructed with one 
    realization of the CMIP6 historical experiment from each model. (b) Multi-
    model mean bias, defined as the difference between the CMIP6 multi-model mean
    and the climatology of the Fifth generation of ECMWF atmospheric reanalyses 
    of the global climate (ERA5). (c) Multi-model mean of the root mean square error
    calculated over all months separately and averaged with respect to the 
    climatology from ERA5. (d) Multi-model-mean bias as the difference between the 
    CMIP6 multi-model mean and the climatology from ERA5. Also shown is the multi-
    model mean bias as the difference between the multi-model mean of (e) high
    resolution and (f) low resolution simulations of four HighResMIP models and the 
    climatology from ERA5......"
